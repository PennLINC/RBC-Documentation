<div style="text-align: right"> - Damian Conway </div>
<hr />
<p>In this documentation about documentation, we’re going to outline how you can start writing documentation for your work and contribute to this site.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>You will need a <a href="https://github.com">Github account</a> to be able to contribute; this website is automatically generated by a code repository on Github and is written primarily in markdown, so that’s where we’re going to keep our focus on this task. There is <em>no requirement</em> that you have prior knowledge about how to code, and the first part of this tutorial will focus on contributing via the Github web interface (so you have nothing to download).</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1-starting-new-documentation">Scenario 1: Starting New Documentation</h2>

<p>As a prerequisite to starting new documentation, you should have an idea of where this tutorial may fit in the context of the site. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">just-the-docs</code>’ structure allows us to create nested directories (folders) so we can organize our thoughts and documents efficiently. If this documentation fits under another topic, please create a new file in the appropriate folder. Otherwise, create a new folder for the topic.</p>

<p>All folders should fall under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RBC-Documentation/docs/</code>, and often a single markdown file is enough for some documentation — it would be the ‘homepage’ of that topic.</p>

<p>RBC-Documentation/docs/foo/foo_processing.md`</p>

<p>In this case, you can create a new file right from the Github:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/adding_a_new_file.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Note: you don’t have to explicitly create folders in the Github web interface; just type out your filename and path with backslashes and Github will automatically create the directory structure for you.</em></p>

<h2 id="scenario-2-contributing-to-existing-documentation">Scenario 2: Contributing to Existing Documentation</h2>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are contributing to existing documentation, then the process is simpler. All you will need to do is navigate to the file on Github, and click the edit button to begin editing:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/editing_existing_file.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<p>Markdown is a great language to write documentation in. It is flexible, yet explicit, and easy to pick up. See <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">this guide</a> for more on markdown.</p>

<p>Importantly, you must also include a YAML header in all of your markdown files. YAML (YetAnotherMarkdownLanguage) is a language used to create headers in markdown files, and these headers provide specific instructions to other programs on <em>how</em> to render a markdown document. YAML headers are begun right at the top of the document and are fenced in by 3 hyphens. Anything within a YAML header is of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key: value</code>, and the keys can describe a number of things. For example, this document’s YAML header is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: default
title: Writing Your Own Docs
parent: Contributing
has_toc: true
nav_order: 1
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> are self explanatory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parent</code> describes the fact that this page is a child page of the Contributing document, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_toc</code> tells the renderer that this page should have a table of contents. For more on the available YAML header options for this site, see <a href="/docs/just-the-docs_documentation/navigation-structure/">this page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="committing-your-changes">Committing Your Changes</h1>

<p>Once your edits are complete, you will need to commit them to the repository. This basically means you are happy with the changes you’ve made to the code, and you want to take a snapshot of it in this state; additionally, committing code to this repository is the mechanism that causes new data to render automatically to the website. While you write in markdown, you can also preview the format of the changes in Github’s web page using the “preview” button (see below).</p>

<p>We recommend, if you are unfamiliar with how this works under the hood, that you always commit your changes to a new branch (i.e. a separate version) so that someone can review and test your changes in a Pull Request (a code proposition, if you will). You can change and describe the branch you’re committing to at the bottom of the page:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/committing-changes.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On the next page you can explicitly ask for someone to review the changes to your code before they are <em>merged</em> into the main codebase, after which, the changes are rendered.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/request-reviewer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you are ready, hit “Submit” and your code will be reviewed and merged into the code base. Once this is done, your new documentation will show up automatically on the website in a matter of minutes!</p>

<h1 id="merge-conflicts--syncing">Merge Conflicts &amp; Syncing</h1>

<p>Sometimes, when you’ve been working on contributing code, you may find that someone else has been working on the same file. This creates a merge conflict when you try to put your changes together. To solve this, it may be necessary to get your files back on track with whatever has happened while you were editing — this is called <em>syncing your fork</em>, and is basically everything we discussed above but in reverse. The steps are as follows (we will use the terms “you” to denote your forked repository, and “them” to denote the repository you forked from):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the Github <em>compare</em> tool to compare your repository against the one you forked; initially, it will have theirs as the <em>base repository</em> on the left, and your fork as the <em>head repository</em> on the right. This means a pull request will ask to merge <em>head into base</em>… We want to accomplish the opposite!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch the base repository to your fork; you’ll now get a message that says you have no changes to compare (it is you comparing with you, after all).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on “compare against forks” at the top, and change the head (on the right) to <em>their</em> repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you can see the commits that <em>they</em> made since you forked and started working, if any; from this page, start a pull request, which is essentially you, <em>asking you</em>, if you want their commits added to your fork.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can see this process explained in further detail <a href="https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="for-professionals">For Professionals</h1>

<p>This section describes how to accomplish the above workflow on your local machine, and test it there before committing changes.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-1">Getting Started</h2>

<p>One preferred way to add documentation is to spin up and run a webpage on your local machine, which will dynamically and automatically update as you write. You can then test and review changes as they would appear on the website without risk of damaging the public-facing site and without going back and forth with the commit workflow above. Sounds great, huh?</p>

<p>To do this, though, there is a little bit of overhead, mainly:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A web browser (duh)</li>
  <li>A program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code></li>
  <li>A program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code></li>
</ol>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> is a popular language for web development and has a multitude of templates available, so it makes sense that this website is built on one of them. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> on the other hand is what’s called a <em>static site generator</em>. It takes written documents and parses them into static websites (i.e. ones that don’t need interactive features or a database backend). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> to create pretty websites, while Github uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> to publish websites on the internet for users and projects. Make sense? If not, it’s no matter. You will only need to do a few main things to get started with local testing for contributing to this site.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-test-locally">How To Test Locally</h2>

<p>First, clone this repository to your local machine:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC-Documentation.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, make sure you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> installed; the best way to check this is to do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which ruby</code>, and if there is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> program found, it’s recommended you install it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> (most Linux and MacOS machines already use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> as a package manager akin to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code>, see <a href="https://brew.sh/">this guide</a> to find out how to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> first if you don’t have it).</p>

<p>To install ruby, just do:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install ruby

# YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ALSO ADD IT TO YOUR PATH LIKE SO:

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> using a ruby “gem”, by doing the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># PERMISSIONS MAY BE REQUIRED

gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this last step, you instruct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> to take all of the templates and files in the current directory and spin them up into a webpage, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> will serve it on your local machine. The instruction for this, from the root directory of the repo:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd RBC-Documentation
bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Configuration file: /Users/mac/BBL/PennLINC.github.io/_config.yml
            Source: /Users/mac/BBL/PennLINC.github.io
       Destination: /Users/mac/BBL/PennLINC.github.io/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
                    done in 4.378 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/mac/BBL/PennLINC.github.io'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000//
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’re in business! Just visit http://127.0.0.1:4000// in your web browser to view the local version of PennLINC.github.io!</p>

<p>Now, you can edit files locally in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/</code>, and whenever you save the file, the local web page will update to reflect those changes! When you’re done, hit CTRL-C to stop serving the site, and then commit and push your changes to Github to put them on the internet.</p>
